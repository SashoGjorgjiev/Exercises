7. Abstract Classes and Methods
Create an abstract class called Shape that has:

An abstract method calculateArea().
Create two subclasses:

Circle, which implements calculateArea() (use the formula: Ï€ * radius^2).
Rectangle, which implements calculateArea() (use the formula: width * height).
Bonus: Add a method in the abstract class that prints a description of the shape, e.g., "This is a circle."
