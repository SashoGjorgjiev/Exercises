Interface: Create a Transport Interface
Create an interface Transport with methods move() and fuelType().
Implement the interface in classes Car, Bike, and Plane. Each class should have its own implementation for move() and fuelType() (e.g., a car runs on gasoline, a plane on jet fuel, and a bike on manpower).
Create instances of each class and test the methods.
