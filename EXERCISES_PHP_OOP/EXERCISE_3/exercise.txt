3. Constructor and Destructor
Create a class called Person that has:

A name and an age.
A constructor that sets the name and age when a new person is created.
A destructor that outputs a message when a person object is destroyed.
Bonus: Add a method called introduce() that prints something like "Hi, my name is John and I am 25 years old."
