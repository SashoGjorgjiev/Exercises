 Create a Vehicle Abstract Class
Create an abstract class Vehicle with an abstract method fuelEfficiency().
Create subclasses Truck and Motorcycle, each implementing fuelEfficiency() to calculate the efficiency based on their own criteria (e.g., mpg or liters per 100 km).
Add a method to Vehicle to describe the type of vehicle.
